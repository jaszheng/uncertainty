# uncertainty

This folder contains readings and research related to the the impact of uncertainty on the economy.

Uncertainty has been frequently cited as one of the causes as well as the effects of the Global
Financial crisis (GFC). Hence, it is without a doubt that concerns about uncertainty and its impact
on economic performance have increased around the world since the GFC. However, understanding
economic uncertainty is difficult as it is not directly observable, making it difficult to measure. Over
the last decade, the empirical literature on this topic has grown rapidly. There is a large empirical
literature that focuses on measuring uncertainty in different ways and assessing the impact of
uncertainty shocks on economies.

In assessing the impact of uncertainty shocks on economies, a large focus has been on looking
at international spillovers in uncertainty and the different transmission channels for uncertainty
to impact Gross Domestic Product (GDP) growth. However, the majority of these studies have
focused on the United States. Bloom (2014), Castelnuovo and Pellegrino (2017) and Bloom (2017)
provide a summary of the empirical literature.

The following summarises the different streams of research that have looked at the impact of
uncertainty on the economy.
